# Today in History (Simplified Version)

A funny project built on React, which shows you the events that happend on the same day as when you visit the app, but in different year in the past. This is an application made for education and training on React. The original version include backend parts and account system.

## Getting Started

- On the repository folder (from your local machine), run npm init
- Run npm install
- Run npm start
- The app will run on port 3000
- Enjoy the APP

## How to Use
- Very simple, at first time run, a random event or birthday/death day of a famous person will show up. You have extra information and image (if possible) as illustration.

- A button near the info paragraph leads you to the wikipedia page!

- Click on "More Events" to see next random event!

### API 
- The api is get from: https://byabbe.se/on-this-day/
- I also used WikiAPI: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page

### Important Library
- react-bootstrap: My favourite!
- create-react-app framework: very good to build app

### Deployment
- You can run npm build to make a build folder. Put it inside backend or a main app!

## Versioning
- 1.0.0 UI
This version do not support account system. Advance version can be found in a different repository.

## Wait a minute ... what about the "advanced version"? Where is it?
- The final version of this app include a backend, a supported account authorization and authentication system based on JWT token. Also, we have api call to serverless backend on AWS Lambda. In addition, I use DynamoDB to store data.

- Technology i used in this verion: DynamoDB, expressJS, serverless framework, aws-sdk, I also did deploy the app successfully on Amazon by Elastic Beanstalk.

- You can see the below video to have a quick overview on my app.
